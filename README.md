# Tutorials

Read the two exotic tutorials as a preparation for workshops you will have on Tuesday and Wednesday. Make sure you understand the basics of these frameworks as they are required for those workshops.

* **numpy** - read the [official numpy getting-started tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)
* **pandas** - read the [official pandas getting-started tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)

Feel free to actually install those packages and try them yourselves. There are many ways to open a python environment and start working, it is suggested you try all of them:

* Opening the python interpreter directly by opening the `anaconda prompt` and then lacunhing the interpreter by writing `python`.

* Opening a jupyter notebook by opening the `anaconda prompt`, moving to your working directory with `cd`, and then writing `jupyter notebook`.
